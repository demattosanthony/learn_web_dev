## The command line

The command line interface (CLI) dates back to the early days of computing in the 1960s, where text-based commands were used to interact with computers. Before graphical interfaces like Windows or macOS, users had to type commands to perform tasks. CLIs have evolved but remain a fundamental tool because they provide direct access to the operating system, making them faster and more powerful than graphical interfaces in many cases.

Learning the CLI is valuable because it teaches you the basics of how computers operate and helps you control them at a deeper level. Mastery of the command line allows for automation, faster navigation, and the ability to manage systems or servers more efficiently, especially in programming and development environments.

I'll now search for some resources to help you learn more about it.

The command line interface (CLI) is a fundamental tool for any programmer, offering a way to interact with a computer through text-based commands. It originated in the 1960s, long before graphical interfaces existed. Its simplicity allows users to perform complex tasks like navigating file systems, running programs, and automating repetitive tasks efficiently. Although modern graphical interfaces are common, the CLI remains essential for developers, particularly for managing servers, automating workflows, and using tools like Git and Docker.

Learning the command line is valuable because it provides deeper control over your computer, making it easier to troubleshoot issues, automate tasks, and manage files without relying on a mouse. For new programmers, the CLI builds a solid foundation for understanding how systems work beneath the surface, helping them transition to more advanced development environments.
